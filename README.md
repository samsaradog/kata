Code exercises
---------------

These are the results of several kata built as part of my apprenticeship at 8th Light. All of the files contain both the test and implementation. You can run the Ruby files with:

rspec \<filename\>
	
This is what we have so far:

FizzBuzz<br>
Prime Factors<br>
Roman Numerals<br>
Money Changer<br>
